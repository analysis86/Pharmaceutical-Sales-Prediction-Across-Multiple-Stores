# Project-6_Pharmaceutical Sales prediction across multiple stores

• In this project, we have to Use Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches to predict the Pharmaceutical sales store(s) sales depending on factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting the sales across the various stores.

## Task-1 Exploration of customer purchasing behaviour

• In Task-1, we have done EDA part in notebook folder and checking all available features,
 checking their interactions and correlation as well as their variability with respect to the
 target.
 
  • In this task, we seek to explore the behaviour of customers in the various stores.

 ## Task-2 Prediction of Pharmaceutical store Sales
• Data Preprocessing,
• Building models with sklearn pipelines,
• Choosing a loss function,
• Post Prediction analysis,
• Serialize models,
• Building model with deep learning, and
• Using MLFlow to serve the prediction
