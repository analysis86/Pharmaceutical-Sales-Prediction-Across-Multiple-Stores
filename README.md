# Project-6_Pharmaceutical Sales prediction across multiple stores

• In this project, we have to Use Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to predict the Pharmaceutical sales store(s) sales depending on factors such 
  as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting the sales across the various stores.

## Task-1 Exploration of customer purchasing behaviour

• In Task-1, we have done EDA part in NoteBook folder and checking all available features,
  checking their interactions and correlation as well as their variability with respect to the
  target.
 
 • In this task, we seek to explore the behaviour of customers in the various stores.

 ## Task-2 Prediction of store Sales
 
• Data Preprocessing

• Building models with sklearn pipelines

• Choose a loss function

• Post Prediction analysis

• Serialize models

• Building model with deep learning

• Using MLFlow to serve the prediction

### This part is done in NoteBook folder (Task-2)

# Task-3  Serving predictions on a web interface

• This part is done in Task-3_app.py
